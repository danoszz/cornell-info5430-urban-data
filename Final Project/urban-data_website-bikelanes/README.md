# Assignment 1: Hard Systems - LinkNYC kiosks

**Identification, visualization and analysis**

Some of the most apparent systems in cities are the so-called “hard systems”, streets, sidewalks, bridges, tunnels, pipes and other types of infrastructure. Your first assignment is to identify, analyze and visualize a hard system in New York. You will identify and map the components that make up the system, including its network structure, agents, nodes and flows.

## Idenfication

Draw an interactive map that can illustrate how new hard systems are not creating equal access. The main inspiraction was the inequality in WiFi access addressed in the [Just a Quarter of New York’s Wi-Fi Kiosks Are Up. Guess Where](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/nyregion/linknyc-wifi-connections.html) articl by the NYT.
### Motivation

* Search for digital divide by mapping geolocation data
* Question statement of Hard Systems: what is considered pyshical infrstructure? Is WiFi tangible?
  * Since the kiosks have an physical location, would this define them as hard system?
  * Will this be part of future digital infrastructure?
* Find supporting dataset of assumptions while confronting personal bias

## Visualisation

To find a fitting visualisation we first initiated a visual research and created a moodboard for further artdirection

### Process

1. Tooling: Finding the right tool in terms of flexibility, aeasthics, learning curve, future usage, interaction
2. Art direction: what kind of style should we use?
3. Examples: not reinventing the wheel
4. Requirements: defining minimal requirements for a succesful end product

## Analysis

Identify the different elements of this system. Define who and what are the agents and their attributes 

1. Network
2. Nodes
3. Agents
4. Flows


Analyze the network, flows and connections between nodes
